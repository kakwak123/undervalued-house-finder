    "description": "There are houses that tick boxes, and then there are homes that feel right the moment you step inside. 40 Hancock Drive, Ferntree Gully brings a sense of space, light, and easy family living that feels just right from the moment you walk in.<br/><br/>Tucked in a peaceful pocket surrounded by high-quality homes and leafy streets, this is where family comfort meets timeless style. Thoughtfully updated and beautifully maintained, every space here has been designed to make life easy - and enjoyable - from day one.<br/><br/>Inside, the home opens into light-filled, welcoming spaces that strike the perfect balance between relaxation and functionality. The four generous bedrooms offer plenty of room for the whole family, while the two bathrooms have been crafted for comfort and convenience. At the heart of the home, you’ll find a sleek, updated kitchen, complete with modern appliances, ample storage, and a breakfast bar that naturally draws everyone together. Whether it’s morning coffee before school or a shared meal on a Sunday night, this is a kitchen that truly brings people closer.<br/><br/>There’s no shortage of living space, either. With two large and versatile living areas, there’s room for every mood - movie nights, quiet reading, playtime, or entertaining guests. Each zone flows effortlessly, creating a sense of openness and calm that families will love.<br/><br/>Comfort is assured year-round with ducted heating and evaporative cooling throughout, while solar panels add an energy-efficient touch that helps keep running costs down.<br/><br/>When it’s time to step outside, the home continues to impress. Perfectly positioned on a northerly block with a southerly aspect, the rear yard enjoys an abundance of sunshine throughout the day. The spacious outdoor entertaining area is designed for making memories, while the surrounding gardens are low-maintenance yet lush, offering both beauty and practicality.<br/><br/>And then there’s the location - one of Ferntree Gully’s most sought-after pockets, where community spirit meets natural beauty. Weekend mornings might start with a stroll through Tim Neville Arboretum or a picnic at Wally Tew Reserve, while nearby Ferntree Gully Quarry Reserve offers tranquil walking tracks and sweeping views. For those who love the outdoors, the iconic 1000 Steps Kokoda Memorial Track and scenic Koolamara Waters walking trails are just moments away, providing endless opportunities to connect with nature.<br/><br/>Just a few minutes down the road, Mountain Gate Shopping Centre caters to all your daily needs, and Ferntree Gully Train Station ensures an easy city commute. Families will also appreciate the excellent selection of local schools, sporting clubs, and leafy parks that make this area such a joy to call home.<br/>    ",

    "description": "Set on a generous corner block of approximately 720sqm, this freshly updated Boronia beauty brings together everything you want in a home - lifestyle, flexibility, and that elusive something special. It’s the kind of home that makes weekends feel longer and life feel a little more effortless.<br/><br/>Behind its secure gated frontage, a charming entrance foyer sets the tone - calm, considered, and beautifully practical - with a powder room for guests. Step into the expansive main living zone, where plush carpet and a chic Dulux palette create an instant sense of ease. There’s space to stretch out, unwind, and watch the world slow down, all while enjoying views of the show-stopping feature that defines this home - a spectacular inground pool that wraps the living zones in holiday energy.<br/><br/>The home’s clever U-shaped design allows the sparkling pool to take centre stage, visible from both living areas. The timber kitchen, complete with stainless-steel appliances, breakfast bench, and a casual meals nook, overlooks the pool and palms - a perfect spot for morning coffee or an easy dinner with a view.<br/><br/>Families will love the thoughtful layout, with three robed bedrooms tucked down a carpeted hallway, including a master suite that delivers both glamour and calm. The ensuite is a glitzy showpiece with stone vanity and luxe rain shower, plus pendant lighting, and wall-to-wall built-ins for effortless style. A main bathroom with a timber vanity and spa bath leaves room for a modern makeover down the track, while the home office (or fourth bedroom) with its own external access is ideal for business owners or creative types seeking separation and flow.<br/><br/>Outdoors, the allure continues - three distinct outdoor zones each with their own purpose and personality. A fully fenced front garden with covered decking invites morning cuppas or twilight chats, while the pool zone with spa (covered for all-season use), promises endless summer days. There’s even a side area perfect for secure vehicle storage, with drive-through gates leading to a double garage - heaven for tradies, tinkerers, or caravan owners.<br/><br/>And all of it is just a stroll from Alchester Village’s vibrant cafe scene, local shops, schools, parklands and under 2km to Boronia station - meaning you can walk for your morning latte, but still retreat home to your own private paradise.<br/><br/>At a Glance:<br/><br/>•\tGenerous 720sqm (approx.) corner block offering unique lifestyle flexibility<br/>•\tFreshly updated with new flooring and a modern Dulux palette<br/>•\tLarge carpeted living zone with home office/fourth bedroom and private entrance - ideal for a home business<br/>•\tStriking inground pool & spa at the heart of the home - covered for all-season enjoyment and framed by palms and pavers<br/>•\tTimber kitchen with stainless-steel appliances, breakfast bench, and pool-view meals nook<br/>•\tMaster suite with renovated ensuite - stone vanity, luxe rain shower, pendant lights, and built-ins<br/>•\tMain bathroom with timber vanity and spa bath<br/>•\tThree separately zoned outdoor areas including fenced front garden, side drive/garage area, and pool zone<br/>•\tSecure off-street parking via double gates plus double garage - perfect for tradies, caravans, or boats<br/>•\tSplit system air-conditioning, ceiling fans, and 12 solar panels<br/>•\tWalk to Alchester Village shops, cafes, schools, and under 2km from the station<br/><br/><br/><br/>Disclaimer: All information provided has been obtained from sources we believe to be accurate, however, we cannot guarantee the information is accurate and we accept no liability for any errors or omissions (including but not limited to a property's land size, floor plans and size, building age and condition) Interested parties should make their own enquiries and obtain their own legal advice.<br/>    ",

    "description": "Finding a vacant allotment in the City of Knox that allows you to build your dream family home, or a dual occupancy project is tough, but what if we said we had the next best thing?<br/><br/>Located in a quiet street close to a range of desirable amenities is this prime allotment of 778m2 (approx.) which is ripe for reinvention (STCA). Currently occupied by an original condition three-bedroom, one bathroom weatherboard home, it offers an array of options that could see your dreams come true. <br/><br/>Most will see the value in the generous block of land, removing the home and starting over. Others, however, may decide that renovating and extending the existing dwelling (which has been re-stumped and has a large workshop) holds a greater level of appeal. While you ponder your options, and get your plans and permits in order, you can generate an income by offering the property as a rental. This is sounding better by the minute, isn’t it? <br/><br/>Situated just moments from the heart of Bayswater, and all that comes with that, including buses and the Bayswater Train Station, Mountain High shopping centre and the cafes and restaurants on the local strip, a range of schools, and open green spaces like the Dandenong Creek Trail and Marie Wallace Bayswater Park. You’ll also close to Westfield Knox with its popular Ozone dining and entertainment zone, and Eastlink to aid your CBD and Mornington Peninsula commutes. <br/><br/>Grasp this fabulous opportunity with both hands and start planning the future you deserve.<br/><br/><br/>Loci Real Estate has taken every precaution to ensure the information contained herein is true and accurate, however accept no responsibility and disclaim all liability in respect to any errors, omissions, inaccuracies, or misstatements that may occur.
